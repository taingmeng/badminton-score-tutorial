### Badminton Score Tutroial
---

This project is for my series of tutorial on [Medium](https://medium.com/@taingmeng/build-badminton-score-keeper-with-reactjs-with-voice-recognition-part-1-2ac5fe93dd6b) about the **React**, **Voice Recognition**, and **Text-to-Speech**. The objective is to create a badminton score keeper, in which players can update the score through voice command.
